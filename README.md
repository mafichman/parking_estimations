Sample scripts to estimate curbside occupancy in 15 min intervals using SFPark Sample data.

This is a rough script to give my students in MUSA 508 an idea of how to build demand models for their final project - there is a lot of corner-cutting and rounding and simplistic assumptions that probably need to be altered by the students to make more accurate models.

Based in part on methods used to estimate occupancy [in my thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309231344_An_Evaluation_of_Pittsburgh%27s_Dynamically-Priced_Curb_Parking_Pilot) that estimated elasticities in a dynamic parking scheme in Pittsburgh, PA.
