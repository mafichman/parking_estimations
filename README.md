# parking_estimations
Sample scripts to estimate curbside occupancy in 15 min intervals using SFPark Sample data.

This is a rough script to give my students in MUSA 508 an idea of how to build demand models for their final project - there is a lot of corner-cutting and rounding and simplistic assumptions that probably need to be altered by the students to make more accurate models.

Based in part on methods used to estimate occupancy in my thesis (Fichman, 2016) that estimated elasticities in a dynamic parking scheme in Pittsburgh, PA.
